            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>Every since I was a young boy, I've always loved technology. As a boy my parents would let me handle the lighting on the Christmas Tree. Every year was different because I wanted to improve upon the previous year's experience. This was nothing too high tech, but my parents let me play around. They have always encoured my love of technology.</p>
            <p>I've been in IT Support for over 20 years and what I've learned how to troubleshoot effeciently and that you can never have all of the answers; a routine call is far from routine. Hundreds of factors can cause technology to fail, that is why after successfully troubleshooting the problem, I try to remove as many of the problems for the user. </p>
            <p>I approach every project with the end user's experience in mind. If they are unable to find an answer or are unable to navigate the site successfully then I've failed and I will start to re-working the documentation or the page to make it easier for the user to find the answers they seek. Just like the lights, I'm never satisified with my work, I'm alway looking for ways to improve upon my work.</p>
            <p>I never take myself too seriously and I believe you learn the most by making mistakes. When working with my team, I'll ask if they made any mistakes today and if they reply with no, I say let's keep working until we make some.</p>
            <p>This portfolio is representation of the web and programming projects I have created for myself, my work and my class assignments. They are all made with my passion for learning and improving the overall experience.</p>
