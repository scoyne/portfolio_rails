                <h3>A little more about me </h3>
                <p>Ever since I was a young boy, I've always loved technology. As a boy my parents would let me handle the lighting on the Christmas Tree. Every year was different because I wanted to improve upon the previous year's experience. This was nothing too high tech, but my parents let me play around. They always encouraged my love of technology.</p>
                <p>I've been in IT Support for over 20 years and what I've learned is how to troubleshoot effeciently and that you can never have all of the answers; a routine call is far from routine. Hundreds of factors can cause technology to fail. That is why after successfully troubleshooting the problem, I follow up in making any necessary adjustments I can to eliminate the issue for other users. </p>
                <p>I approach every project with the end user's experience in mind. If they are unable to find an answer or are unable to navigate the site successfully, then I've failed and I re-work the documentation or the page to make it easier for the user to find the answers they seek. Just like the Christmas lights, even when I feel I've done my work well, I'm always looking for ways to improve.</p>
                <p>I never take myself too seriously and I believe you learn the most by making mistakes. When working with my team, I ask if they made any mistakes today and if they reply with no, I say let's keep working until we make some.</p>
                <p>This portfolio is a representation of the web and programming projects I have created for myself, my work and my class assignments. They are all made as a result of my passion for learning and improving the overall experience.</p>
